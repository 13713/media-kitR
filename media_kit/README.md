## Docs

### Brief Start

Basic example.

```dart
import 'package:media_kit/media_kit.dart';

/// Create a new [Player] instance.
final player = Player();

...
/// Open some [Media] for playback.
await player.open(
  Playlist(
    [
      Media('file:///C:/Users/Hitesh/Music/Sample.MP3'),
      Media('file:///C:/Users/Hitesh/Video/Sample.MKV'),
      Media('https://www.example.com/sample.mp4'),
      Media('rtsp://www.example.com/live'),
    ],
  ),
);

...
/// Modify speed, pitch, volume or shuffle state.
player.rate = 1.0;
player.pitch = 1.2;
player.volume = 50.0;
player.shuffle = false;

...
/// Play / Pause
player.play();
player.pause();
player.playOrPause();

...
/// Release allocated resources back to the system.
player.dispose();

...
/// Subscribe to events.
player.streams.playlist.listen((event) {
  /// Trigger UI updates etc.
  print(event);
});
player.streams.playlist.listen((event) {
  /// Trigger UI updates etc.
  print(event);
});
player.streams.position.listen((event) {
  /// Trigger UI updates etc.
  print(event);
});
player.streams.duration.listen((event) {
  /// Trigger UI updates etc.
  print(event);
});
player.streams.audioBitrate.listen((event) {
  /// Trigger UI updates etc.
  if (event != null) {
    print('${event ~/ 1000} KB/s');
  }
});
```

### Rendering Video

Performant & H/W accelerated, automatically fallbacks to S/W rendering if system does not support it.

```dart
import 'package:media_kit/media_kit.dart';
import 'package:media_kit_video/media_kit_video.dart';

class MyScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyScreen({Key? key}) : super(key: key);
  @override
  State<MyScreen> createState() => _MyScreenState();
}

class MyScreenState extends State<MyScreen> {
  // Create a [Player] instance from `package:media_kit`.
  final Player player = Player();
  // Reference to the [VideoController] instance from `package:media_kit_video`.
  VideoController? controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    Future.microtask(() async {
      // Create a [VideoController] instance from `package:media_kit_video`.
      // Pass the [handle] of the [Player] from `package:media_kit` to the [VideoController] constructor.
      controller = await VideoController.create(player.handle);
      // Must be created before opening any media. Otherwise, a separate window will be created.
      setState(() {});
    });
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    Future.microtask(() async {
      // Release allocated resources back to the system.
      await controller?.dispose();
      await player.dispose();
    });
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Video(
      /// Pass the [controller] to display the video output.
      controller: controller,
    );
  }
}
```

For performance reasons (especially in S/W rendering), if you wish to restrain the size of each video frame, you can pass width & height parameters to the `VideoController.create` method.

```dart
final controller = await VideoController.create(
  player.handle,
  width: 1920,
  height: 1080,
);
```

**Note**

- You can limit size of the video output by specifying `width` & `height`.
- By default, both `height` & `width` are `null` i.e. output is based on video's resolution.

```dart
final controller = await VideoController.create(
  player.handle,
  width: 640,                                   // default: null
  height: 360,                                  // default: null
);
```

**Note**

- You can switch between GPU & CPU rendering by specifying `enableHardwareAcceleration`.
- By default, `enableHardwareAcceleration` is `true` i.e. GPU (Direct3D/OpenGL/METAL) is utilized.

```dart
final controller = await VideoController.create(
  player.handle,
  enableHardwareAcceleration: false,            // default: true
);
```

### Detailed Guide

_TODO: documentation_

Try out [the test application](https://github.com/harmonoid/media_kit/blob/master/media_kit_test/lib/main.dart) for now.

## Setup

### Windows

Everything ready. Just add one of the following packages to your `pubspec.yaml`.

```yaml
dependencies:
  ...
  media_kit_libs_windows_video: ^1.0.0       # Windows package for video (& audio) native libraries.
  media_kit_libs_windows_audio: ^1.0.0       # Windows package for audio (only) native libraries.
```

### Linux

System shared libraries from distribution specific user-installed packages are used by-default. You can install these as follows.

#### Ubuntu / Debian

**On user machine you need:**

```bash
sudo apt install libmpv2
```

**On development machine you need:**

```bash
sudo apt install libmpv-dev libmpv2
```

#### Packaging

There are other ways to bundle these within your app package e.g. within Snap or Flatpak. Few examples:

- [Celluloid](https://github.com/celluloid-player/celluloid/blob/master/flatpak/io.github.celluloid_player.Celluloid.json)
- [VidCutter](https://github.com/ozmartian/vidcutter/tree/master/_packaging)

## Goals

The primary goal of [package:media_kit](https://github.com/alexmercerind/media_kit) is to become a **strong, stable, feature-proof & modular** media playback library for Flutter. The idea is to support both **audio & video playback**.

[package:media_kit](https://github.com/alexmercerind/media_kit) makes rendering [**hardware accelerated video playback**](https://github.com/alexmercerind/dart_vlc/issues/345) possible in Flutter.

Since, targetting multiple features at once & bundling redundant native libraries can result in increased bundle size of the application, you can manually select the native libraries you want to bundle, depending upon your use-case. The code is architectured to support multiple platforms & features. Support for more platforms will be added in future.

## Fund Development

If you find [package:media_kit](https://github.com/alexmercerind/media_kit) package(s) useful, please consider sponsoring me.

Since this is first of a kind project, it takes a lot of time to experiment & develop. It's a very tedious process to write code, document, maintain & provide support for free. Your support can ensure the quality of the package your project depends upon. I will feel rewarded for my hard-work & research.
