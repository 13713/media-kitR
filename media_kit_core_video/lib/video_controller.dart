/// VideoController
/// ---------------
///
/// This class is used to initialize & handle the video rendering inside the Flutter widget tree.
///
/// A [VideoController] must be created right after creating the [Player] from `package:media_kit`.
/// Pass the [handle] of the [Player] from `package:media_kit` to the [VideoController] constructor.
///
/// ```dart
/// final player = Player();
/// final controller = VideoController(player.handle);
/// ```
///
/// It is important to [dispose] the [VideoController] when it is no longer needed.
/// It will release the allocated resources back to the system.
///
/// Optionally, fixed [width] & [height] can be passed.
/// Setting smaller [width] & [height] values can result in better performance especially on low-end devices & software rendering.
/// This will cause the video output to use the specified dimensions, instead of the original dimensions of the video.
/// Default is `null`, which means the original dimensions of the video will be used.
///
/// Internally, the [VideoController] invokes platform specific native implementation for video rendering.
/// Hardware acceleration is enabled by default.
/// The implementation will fallback to software rendering if system does not have proper support for it.
///
/// {@endtemplate}
