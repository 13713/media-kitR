  // All the operations involving ANGLE or EGL or libmpv must be performed on

  // Not doing so results in access violations & crashes.
  //
  // Technically, the correct place to do all the video rendering (& thus
  // resize) etc. is on Flutter's render thread itself (exposed as callback in
  // |flutter::GpuSurfaceTexture| & |flutter::PixelBufferTexture|). However,
  // this slows down the UI too much. So, I decided to create our own
  // |ThreadPool| & use it for all the video rendering purposes through one
  // single thread.
  //
  // Secondly, setting a |std::mutex| was not enough. It still resulted in
  // access violations. Maybe it does not provide a fair mutex, which caused
  // race between resize & render.
  //
  // The following operations are performed through the |ThreadPool|:
  // All of these involve ANGLE or OpenGL context etc. etc.
  //
  // * Rendering of video frame i.e. |mpv_render_context_render| is called
  //   through the |ThreadPool| after being notified by
  //   |mpv_render_context_set_update_callback|.
  // * Creation / Disposal of new |VideoOutput| i.e.
  //   |VideoOutputManager::Create| & |VideoOutputManager::Dispose| are called
  //   through the |ThreadPool|. Thus, |mpv_render_context_create| is called &
  //   instantiation of a new |ANGLESurfaceManager| is done through |ThreadPool|
  //   (in |VideoOutput| constructor).
  // * Resizing of |ANGLESurfaceManager| & creation of newly sized Flutter
  //   textures (|flutter::GpuSurfaceTexture| & |flutter::PixelBufferTexture|)
  //   is also done through |ThreadPool|. See |VideoOutput::CheckAndResize|.
  //
  // Thus, creating a new |ThreadPool| with maximum number of worker threads as
  // 1, ensures that all the ANGLE, EGL & libmpv operations are performed on a
  // single thread orderly. This also makes usage of any |std::mutex|
  // unnecessary.
