# Some GPUs/Hardware seem to experience black flickering when rendering with hardware acceleration.
# Calling |glFinish| eliminates this. This seems to be some sort of synchronization problem between Flutter / Monitor / mpv etc.
# Now there are bunch of |glFinish| calls inside |ANGLESurfaceManager| & |VideoOutput| classes which fix any flickering issues.
# There doesn't seem to be any better alternative for OpenGL ES 2.0. See:

# Though |glFinish| is not optimal, it is still way-way better in terms of performance as compared to software rendering.
# Personally, my budget machine with AMD Ryzen 3 2200U with integrated Radeon Vega 3 Mobile Graphics never experienced this issue.
# At most, 4K 30FPS or 1080p 60FPS videos play flawlessly without any major load on the hardware. 4K 60FPS videos certainly experience some frame drops. But nothing that can be referred as flicker.
